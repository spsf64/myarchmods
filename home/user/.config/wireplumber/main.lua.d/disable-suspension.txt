#Noticeable audio delay or audible pop/crack when starting playback
#This is caused by node suspension when inactive.

#With pipewire-media-session:
#Disable this by editing /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/*-monitor.conf depending on where the delay occurs and changing property session.suspend-timeout-seconds to 0 to disable or experiment with other values and see what works.
#Alternatively you can comment out the line suspend-node in /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/media-session.conf.
#Restart both pipewire.service and pipewire-pulse.service to apply these changes, or alternatively reboot.

#With wireplumber, create a new file to overwrite the default configuration:

#~/.config/wireplumber/main.lua.d/51-disable-suspension.lua (or /etc/wireplumber/main.lua.d/51-disable-suspension.lua)
#Instead of disabling suspension entirely, you can also change the timeout value to the desired number of seconds of delay before source suspension.
